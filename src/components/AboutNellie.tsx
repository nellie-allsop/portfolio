						Prior to becoming self employed, I spent several years working at
						one of the UK&apos;s leading autism charities, where I spoke
						publicly on autism and supported autistic volunteers. Thanks to the
						charity, I was able to take part in media training, speak at an NHS
						Confed Expo and receive my autism diagnosis.

								After leaving that role in 2023, I took a leap into the tech
								sector and experienced first hand the levels of understanding of
								autism in the sector, as well as what it&apos;s like to be an
								autistic adult learner on an intensive coding bootcamp.
								<br />
								<br />I continue to remain immersed in current work around
								autism in society, while also working on my coding skills
								(slowly but surely!)
