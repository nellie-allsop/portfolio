# Sole trader website

**Initial project:** build a portfolio
**Final outcome:** not really a portfolio(!) more of a business website for my sole trader work, but I adapted the project over time based on my needs

You can check out the site here: **www.nellieallsop.com**

_I did make use of ChatGPT for this project to help with problem solving and with things like making my work responsive._
